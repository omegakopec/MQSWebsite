	<h3>A Patch of Dryness in the Back of the Throat</h3>
	<p class="preview">&ldquo;My sand and dirt-colored pencils have been whittled away from all of the desert landscapes I have drawn,&rdquo; she said, taking a long draw of a cigarette. It was a lounge-around sort of day. Those were the best. She wore her laziest outfit: gray hoodie borrowed from an old boyfriend, baggy t-shirt, comfy shorts, comfy slippers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just something...&rdquo; she struggled to find words to describe the emotions she felt. &ldquo;Ugh! I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;<i>eerily mysterious</i>&mdash;about a desert. Something I love, but can&rsquo;t quite touch.&rdquo; The Cactus-Man said nothing, so she continued...</p>

	<h3>T&eacute;rasympia</h3>
	<p class="preview">On the bow of a legendary vessel stood the mighty Odysseus. With spears poised and armor equipped, he made ready to do battle against the terrible Scylla and the equally-as-terrible Charybdis. As the ship neared the deadly strait, a young man with perfectly good eyesight approached the battle-ready hero. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you aboard our ship, young Homer,&rdquo; said Odysseus, barely taking his eyes off the peril ahead. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Homer. &ldquo;How else would I find inspiration for my next epic, &lsquo;The Odysseus&rsquo;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;The Odysseus&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s...</p>

	<h3>Erotic Adventures</h3>
	<p class="preview">On a cluttered desk, in a dusty corner, of a dusty attic, a tired old machine sprang to life. It jittered and hiccuped awake, retrieving all of its assets and remembering all of its functions. Finally, it printed a string of text on its screen. It said this&colon; Private-Eye Adventures, 1983, George Phloem. All rights reserved. Programming&colon; George Phloem, Oscar Lucas. Written&colon; MQS. This made the young man excited. He hadn&rsquo;t been entirely sure if his father&rsquo;s ancient computer would still function properly. <i>You got a name?</i> It printed out next, and a prompt appeared...</p>

	<h3>Apollodorus Lost His Bright-Eyed Canary</h3>
	<p class="preview"> August 20th, 7&colon;09 PM, Chinatown - Lower Manhattan. I was pouring sweat. I&rsquo;d been marching down block after block at breakneck speed because I was under the impression that I would be late. As it turned out, the 7&colon;30 bus had been cancelled. Our new bus would leave at 8&colon;30 instead. My comrades and I were situated at the Starbucks down the way from 19 Allen Street. Paul was explaining to Errol how Bitcoin worked. I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to them. There was a madman&rsquo;s journal on the corner seat adjacent to us. The madman paced the cafe...</p>

	<h3>On Music, Dreams, and Writing a New Novel</h3>
	<p class="preview">I&rsquo;ve never been a lucid dreamer. Dreams, I figure, are to be forgotten. Mine especially, because they are real tedious, and comprised of anxiety-ridden conversations with people that I know, or want to know. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s something to do with my teeth, either falling out, becoming painful and dagger-like, or cracking and splintering like a wooden pier that&rsquo;s been hit with an especially lofty sea-vessel. Growing up, I wanted to be the type of person who dreamt of really exciting things, like flying, or falling in love. Those are the most clich&eacute; kind... </p>
