	<h2 class=title>T&#941;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&upsilon;&mu;&pi;&iota;&alpha;</h2>

	<p>On the bow of a legendary vessel stood the mighty Odysseus. With spears poised and armor equipped, he made ready to do battle against the terrible Scylla and the equally-as-terrible Charybdis. As the ship neared the deadly strait, a young man with perfectly good eyesight approached the battle-ready hero.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you aboard our ship, young Homer,&rdquo; said Odysseus, barely taking his eyes off the peril ahead.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Homer. &ldquo;How else would I find inspiration for my next epic, &lsquo;The Odysseus&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;The Odysseus&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s about me, Odysseus! That&rsquo;s fantastic,&rdquo; said he, grinning madly. &ldquo;And may your beautiful eyes never go blind on account me making some kind of selfish decision.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to that,&rdquo; said Homer. &ldquo;But wait, why are you wearing your battle armor? Didn&rsquo;t Circe tell you NOT to try and fight Scylla? Won&rsquo;t it kill us all if you do that?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Homer! The beast must be destroyed, for her own sake. For she is too ugly to live.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>As if Scylla&rsquo;s ears were burning, it poked a third of it&rsquo;s heads out of it&rsquo;s murky lair, and peered around for a snack.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I mean, look at her&colon; that scaly reptilian skin, dripping with slime!&rdquo; said Odysseus, who felt that they were still far enough away to safely insult the beast.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; agreed Homer. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty gross.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;And those nasty jowls!&rdquo; continued Odysseus. &ldquo;<i>Yeuch!</i> Someone ought to go up there and pick the sailor out of her teeth. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Homer. &ldquo;Dumb whor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted a stern, yet feminine, voice.</p>

	<p>Homer and Odysseus turned on their heels, and before them stood a maidenly figure with long dark hair.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;By the matted beard of Poseidon! Who let a woman aboard our ship?&rdquo; exclaimed Odysseus, brandishing a spear. &ldquo;Are you a sign from the Gods? Or have you come to lure us into the depths with your womanly charms? Answer me, lady! What kind of shape-shifting creature are you?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Hold on now, put that away. What&rsquo;s all of this nonsense about Gods and beards?&rdquo; cried the mysterious maiden, glaring defiantly. &ldquo;Surely you must know why I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Odysseus pondered this for a moment. He was a clever man, but somehow this had slipped his mind.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Ody?&rdquo; said Homer, trying on a new nickname for our stalwart hero. &ldquo;You utterly destroyed that whole tribe of people and kept their women as slaves.&rdquo;</p>

	 <p>Odysseus thought hard, but he still couldn&rsquo;t remember, &ldquo;Eurylochus!&rdquo; he called.</p>

	<p>The scruffy second-in-command appeared from below deck (where he had been hiding to avoid getting eaten), &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Do we have any women aboard this ship?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, the Kikones women. We&rsquo;ve been storing them in amongst the cargo, with the wine, goats and other supplies that we scavenged.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Our pen is the one next to the goats,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;My name is T&eacute;rasympia, high basket-weaver among the Kikones.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Damn, but what&rsquo;s a basket weaver doing aboard my ship?&rdquo; said Odysseus stroking his beard contemplatively.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;We already established that Ody,&rdquo; said Homer, not writing any of this down, but keeping a mental note of it.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Not now, Homer,&rdquo; said Odysseus. &ldquo;I really need to concentrate.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; began T&eacute;rasympia. &ldquo;I was going to come up here and commandeer the ship and leave you all to die at the hands of Scylla, but now I feel that I have a duty to address something that&rsquo;s been bugging me.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Speak up demon, or witch, or whatever you are!&rdquo; said Odysseus, eyeing the basket weaver with suspicion and intrigue.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia. &ldquo;The other women and I have noticed&mdash;either from conversations we overhear through the cracks in the floorboards, or from the stories that your men tell when they have their way with us&mdash;stories of terrible she-monsters with teeth and claws and the like&mdash;it all seems very misogynistic.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;What? No. Definitely not,&rdquo; interrupted Odysseus.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her,&rdquo; said Eurylochus. &ldquo;What would she know? After all, she&rsquo;s just a woman.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia. &ldquo;But besides the fact that you keep us in barrels next to livestock, and, y&rsquo;know, we&rsquo;re literally your sex slaves now and all, it seems like you guys are a bunch of women haters.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>At these words, the three men merely guffawed and shook their heads. Not in unison, because that would be weird, but each eventually in their own rhythm.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Odysseus. &ldquo;Us? Women haters?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yeah! That&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; chimed in Eurylochus. &ldquo;We love women!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia, rolling her eyes.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;No really, I like women,&rdquo; said Homer. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you guys are softer and dumber than us men are.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Okay, great,&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia, making an effort to get back onto the point of her argument. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what you&rsquo;re doing? You feminize every monster, whether they&rsquo;re bird, reptile, fish or what-have-you.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Suddenly, Odysseus had a terrible thought&colon; that all of this might be true. Could it be?</p>

	<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he denied it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous, us men are not women haters. It&rsquo;s just that some of these monsters are actually women. Not all of them are.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Really? Then what about the sphinx?&rdquo; queried T&eacute;rasympia.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Clever cat with a big rack,&rdquo; answered Odysseus, almost instinctively. &ldquo;How fortunate we are that Oedipus solved the riddle. Too bad about his mom though...&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yep, just what I thought. How about the harpies?&rdquo; continued T&eacute;rasympia.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Nasty winged titty-birds. They defecated all over Jason and his men,&rdquo; answered Odysseus.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Medusa?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Not a looker, Perseus could tell ya. Talk about a cold shoulder, right fellas? Get it? &lsquo;Cause she turns them to stone...&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Homer and Eurylochus slapped fives, but T&eacute;rasympia was not amused.</p>

	<p>Suddenly, a barge of haggard old men wearing masks and long robes pulled up to the side of the ship and sang a solemn chorus:</p>

<blockquote>
O brave Odysseus,<br />
Trying to make it home,<br />
With T&eacute;rasympia chastising you,<br />
O what terrible fate!<br />
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
O what terrible truths you&rsquo;ve heard,<br />
Today of all the days,<br />
O could it be true, what&rsquo;s been said?<br />
Charybdis is clearly a vaginal metaphor!<br />
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What a shame, when you know,<br />
These stories were written by men!<br />
It&rsquo;s not like they were trying to be sexist,<br />
That was just the culture back then!<br />
</blockquote>
	
	<p>&ldquo;Hey! Enough of that!&rdquo; shouted Eurylochus. &ldquo;You choruses are all the same with your wooden masks and your melancholy voices. Beat it!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
But we are here,<br />
To add commentary,<br />
Even though,<br />
There&rsquo;s already commentary!<br />
</blockquote>

	<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; wailed Eurylochus.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The sirens!&rdquo; said Odysseus out of nowhere. &ldquo;The sirens were beautiful beyond belief. And their songs so sweet... You see T&eacute;rasympia, not all women&mdash;I mean monsters! Not all monsters are ugly.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Homer and T&eacute;rasympia merely chuckled, as if they were in on a shared secret.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s so funny? Is it wrong for a man to be attracted to a scaly fish woman?&rdquo; said Odysseus.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; said Homer.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Those were man-sirens,&rdquo; said T&eacute;ra.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;No! That can&rsquo;t be right, they were so incredibly gorgeous,&rdquo; lamented Odysseus. &ldquo;So curvy...&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yes, very feminine, still male,&rdquo; said T&eacute;ra, though she wasn&rsquo;t sure if this had helped her argument at all or weakened it.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Damn, I am so confused now... This shall mess me up for weeks.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The Cyclops,&rdquo; posited Eurylochus, who was finally able to get the chorus to leave, after bribing them with goats.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yes! Polyphemus! He was a male and he was ugly,&rdquo; cried Odysseus. &ldquo;Poor dullard...&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Poor dullard?&rdquo; cried T&eacute;rasympia. &ldquo;You feel sorrow and pity for Polyphemus, yet you&rsquo;d kill Scylla without a second thought?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it...&rdquo; said Odysseus. &ldquo;Homer, help me out, who&rsquo;s winning... Am I winning?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Homer merely shrugged.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;You know what, forget it,&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just jump ship and take my chances with Charybdis. Us &lsquo;monsters&rsquo; should stick together.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Wait T&eacute;rasympia! I have a plan. It&rsquo;s such a great plan,&rdquo; said Odysseus taking a heroic stance. &ldquo;We shall sail close enough to the cave so that I can jump inside and have a look at the things genitals. Then we&rsquo;ll know for certain.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Though T&eacute;rasympia wanted to prove her case, she also knew deep in her heart that this idea was probably not very great at all, though Homer spoke up about it first.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Gaia to Ody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t reach that cave, Circe said that the walls were too high and slippery.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Then I will peer into the cave with my hawk-like eyes and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Just then, there was a horrendous dog-like whine, and six terrible heads launched out and each snatched a member of Odysseus&rsquo; crew.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic men, and miss &lsquo;Sympia!&rdquo; called out Odysseus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re far enough away that the thing has to stretch it&rsquo;s body outside of the cave to reach us! I think I... Yes! It&rsquo;s rubbing it&rsquo;s pelvis up against the outer lip of the cave! Let me just have a peek,&rdquo; what Odysseus saw that day was chthonian and wondrous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s... my, it&rsquo;s so weird... that&rsquo;s like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen... why, I can&rsquo;t tell what it is! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>They somehow made it passed.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Well, T&eacute;ra, I guess you were right,&rdquo; admitted Odysseus. &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t a woman after all. It was an ugly genderless creature! Perhaps I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Perhaps?&rdquo; lamented T&eacute;ra. &ldquo;It got Homer! You monster!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Odysseus&rsquo; heart was struck with a pang of sorrow, like one of Eros&rsquo; bolts, except it made you real sad instead of in-love.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;No, I... Curse you vile Scylla!!! You genderless fiend!&rdquo; he sobbed.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Can men not be monsters?&rdquo; said T&eacute;rasympia, scanning the crew for sympathetic eyes. &ldquo;When Oedipus tears the eyes out of his face for his children to see, with tendrils and viscera flowing out, is he not a monster? When weird-uncle Hades drags starry-eyed Persephone down into the pits of Tartarus, away from her loving mother, is he not a monster then? When wrathful Achilles defiles the corpse of Hector, such a brave young man, with so much hope, and so much promise, and so much...&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we get the point,&rdquo; interrupted Eurylochus.</p>

	<p>Then there was a sudden <i>&ldquo;thunk!&rdquo;</i> as a limp young body slammed against the deck of the ship.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Homer!&rdquo; cried Odysseus. &ldquo;Homer, speak to me. Tell me that you&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Ow, yeah, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; he said getting up to his feet. &ldquo;I was telling her&mdash;scylla, of course&mdash;about our conversation about gender, and she thought it was good that we were all so open-minded, so she let me go.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;She? Wait a minute, is that what a vagina looks like?&rdquo; wondered Odysseus. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen one in so long... doesn&rsquo;t a vagina have a swirling vortex of oceanic waves where sailors meet their doom beneath the crushing depths&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a whirlpool,&rdquo; interrupted T&eacute;rasympia.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Ouch. I think that I hit the deck so hard that my eyes popped out of their sockets,&rdquo; said Homer, who was strikingly calm about all of this. &ldquo;I guess that I won&rsquo;t be able to write the Odysseus down on a papyrus now... maybe I should just make it an oral tradition and I&rsquo;ll just pass it down through the generations.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about that, by the way. Maybe you should just call it &lsquo;The Odyssey&rsquo;, it kind of sounds better,&rdquo; suggested T&eacute;rasympia.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Hey yeah! Odyssey. Wow, that&rsquo;s such a good idea, I wish that I had thought of it,&rdquo; said Homer.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Homer,&rdquo; said Odysseus. &ldquo;You can just take all of the credit for it, and no one will ever know.&rdquo;</p>
