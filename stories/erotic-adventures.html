	<p>(These are two excerpts from an unpublished novel called <i>Erotic Adventures</i>.)</p>
	<h2 class=title>ANUS.exe</h2>

	<p>On a cluttered desk, in a dusty corner, of a dusty attic, a tired old machine sprang to life. It jittered and hiccuped awake, retrieving all of its assets and remembering all of its functions. Finally, it printed a string of text on its screen. It said this:</p>

<p class=eros>
Private-Eye Adventures<br />
&copy;1983, George Phloem. All rights reserved.<br />
Programming: George Phloem, Oscar Lucas.<br />
Written: MQS.
</p>

	<p>This made the young man excited. He hadn&rsquo;t been entirely sure if his father&rsquo;s ancient computer would still function properly.</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You got a name?</i>
</p>

	<p>It printed out next, and a prompt appeared below it, which looked like this:</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>User &gt;  __</b>
</p>

	<p>The young man puzzled over this question for all of a minute.</p> 

<p class=eros>
<b>User &gt;  ANUS__</b>
</p>

	<p>He thought that it would be funny if the game constantly referred to him as ANUS.</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You are in a dimly lit room, facing north. In front of you is a rusty iron door. To the east, in the corner, there&rsquo;s a moldy mattress on a springy, grey-green bed-frame. There&rsquo;s an old nightstand sitting at the foot of the bed. It has one drawer. Underneath you is a worn-out rug. Beside you is Lieutenant Claire Moore, your crime fightin&rsquo; buddy. She&rsquo;s here to provide back up for you while you try and solve this mystery. What do you do?</i>
</p>

	<p>ANUS looked around&mdash;in his imagination of course, because this was just a game.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; open door__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s locked.</i>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lame,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; move east__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>You face east.</i>
</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Well that helped,&rdquo; he thought again.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; inspect drawer__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>The drawer belongs to what was once a beautiful oaken nightstand. You can tell that skilled craftsmanship must have gone into making such a luxuriously handsome thing like this. Now here it lay, a shadow of its former glory&mdash;twisted and gnarled from years of abuse and water damage. Neglected, it is left here to rot in this dark dungeon.  A glimmer of the love it once felt still remains. You can tell as you stare upon its knob, there is hope. Hope that one day some heroic soul will venture down here, with sandpaper, and wood glue, and a coat of weatherproof paint, sweep it off it&rsquo;s four feet, and whisk it away from this dark hole. There is hope.</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; open drawer__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>You found a key.</i>
</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere,&rdquo; continued ANUS&rsquo;s riveting internal monologue.</p>


<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; unlock door__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You need to use a key to unlock this door.</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; use key on door__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>The key fits the lock. All of the mechanisms within the door click and spring into place. The door swings open&mdash; Just kidding. You can tell as you try and push it open that this door is rusted shut and has been for some time now. No matter how hard you push, it won&rsquo;t budge, and that&rsquo;s not only because it&rsquo;s rusted onto the doorframe, but also because the internal mechanisms are completely corroded.</i>
</p>

	<p>This new advancement made our dear friend ANUS both somewhat angrier and somewhat more determined.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; jiggle key in lock__</b>
</p> 

	<p>&ldquo;This is definitely going to work,&rdquo; continued ANUS&rsquo;s thoughts, full heartedly.</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You broke the key.</i>
</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Why did I think that would work?&rdquo;</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; kick open door__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>The door doesn&rsquo;t budge. You broke your leg.</i>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; excuse me?__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>
Don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;excuse me&rsquo; is. Your friend, Lt. Moore, offers some incite: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been completely useless this entire time. Maybe I should try kicking the door open? With my advanced training, I will have a much higher chance of doing it successfully. Would you like me to kick the door open?&rdquo;
</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; yes__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>Lt. Moore broke a leg.</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; fuck you__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>You try to fuck the narrator, but you can&rsquo;t. He doesn&rsquo;t exist.</i>
</p>

	<p>ANUS was completely thrown off by this last dialogue. At first he was confused, but then he became intrigued, even more so then he already was.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; go fuck yourself__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
<i>You try to fuck yourself, but you can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s impossible.</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; fuck Lt. Moore__</b>
</p> 

<p class=eros>
You fuck Lt. Moore.
</p>

	<p>ANUS sat for a moment, anticipating the rest of the text. He thought for sure that there was more to it than that. He waited patiently for the game to reward his discovery with a fully detailed description. But alas, that one short sentence was all that the programmers had written. Private-Eye Adventures had broken ANUS&rsquo; spirit. He could no longer stand the terseness of said seemingly fun, text-based adventure game.</p>

	<p>He threw the keyboard across the room. It slammed onto the ground with a great crack. The F-key flew off and landed into some lost corner of the universe.
ANUS, took a couple of intense deep breaths, counted to seventeen (because he needed seven extra numbers to calm himself down), carefully picked the keyboard up off of the ground, and placed it back onto the desk. He wasn&rsquo;t done yet. Some wiley game from the 1980&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t going to conquer him. Not now, not ever.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; inspect Lt. Moore__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>
You and Lt. Moore are lying naked on the moldy mattress to the east. The both of you smell like mildew. Your clothes are strewn across the oaken nightstand, which makes it feel somewhat loved. It sobs discreetly. You can&rsquo;t hear it, because its cries are inaudible. She holds you close, her arms around you, pressing you close to her bosom. She whispers to you &ldquo;Not bad for a rookie&rdquo;. You peer up from her huge gazongas. You see that her hair is cut to shoulder length. It had been dyed pink, but was now faded to almost-white. She is warm, but the room is cold and stagnant. Icy drafts roll in, making you shiver, so you hold her closer, nuzzling your face into her balloon-like chest. Years ago, her husband, Sgt. Moore, had asked her to get some work done. She was never enough for Sgt. Moore. He had died a miserable, merciless death at the hands of drug-dealing mercenaries. She still misses him some of the time. Claire has legs that are strong and powerful&mdash;probably from kicking so many doors open in her years on the force. Her leg is still broken and so is yours. Both of you are in pain and ecstasy from the &rsquo;broken leg sex&rsquo; that you had just a moment ago. After some more fondling, lip-locking, and fooling around, she gets up and says &ldquo;Well, now what?&rdquo;
</i>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; uck Lt. moore__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>Don&rsquo;t know how to &lsquo;uck&rsquo; something.</i>
</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot about that,&rdquo; started ANUS&rsquo;s thoughts again. He had now begun to regret his initial fit of anger.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; have sex with Lt. Moore__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>
&ldquo;What? Again?&rdquo; says Claire. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we just have sex? Come on ANUS, can&rsquo;t you at least pretend that you&rsquo;re interested in solving this fucking mystery?&rdquo;
</i>
</p>

	<p>ANUS had already gotten what he wanted out of this experience, he was already a winner. He would have turned the game off right there and then, while he was still ahead, but he had to try one more thing.</p>

<p class=eros>
<b>ANUS &gt; have sex with nightstand__</b>
</p>

<p class=eros>
<i>
You walk up to the nightstand, penis in hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s finally happening,&rdquo; it says inaudibly. You pull open the drawer and stick your penis inside. You then open and close the drawer on your dick, not too rough, until you cum inside of it. Your johnson is covered in splinters. Your semen magically restores the nightstand to its former glory. It speaks again, but this time you can hear it: &ldquo;You really are the chosen one! I knew that someday someone like you would cum! Now that I&rsquo;m free, I can break open that rusty iron door with my mind!&rdquo; The door begins to buckle and glow with heat. It then explodes open with a large crash. But sadly, metal shrapnel shoots out in all directions, killing you and Lt. Moore.
</i>
</p>
<p class=eros>
<i>
The End.
</i>
</p>

	<p>And at that, our hero ANUS yanked the power cord from the wall, and the old-timey computer flicked back into its slumber-like state of non-use. ANUS then retrieved his modern laptop, found something to masturbate to on the Internet, and went back to writing his research paper.</p>

	<h2 class=title>Thanksgiving Dinner</h2>

	<p>She was lying naked on the floor in the kitchen.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Oh Harold, I seem to have spilled all of the mashed potatoes on my vagina, and I don&lsquo;t want any of it to go to waste. Could you possibly eat some of it off of me?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>His woman was in need, and he wouldn&lsquo;t let her down.</p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;Don&lsquo;t fret, dear MaryAnn, I will assist you.&rdquo; Harold poured the gravy all over her crotch, which was covered in the mashed potatoes. He then grabbed out a shining silver spoon and began to scoop the contents into his mouth.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;My word, these potatoes are fantastic, did you make them yourself?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Umm, yes actually,&rdquo; she was a little confused. &ldquo;Here, don&lsquo;t eat that,&rdquo; she took the spoon from him, &ldquo;eat this instead.&rdquo; She put an entire juicy T-bone steak on her chest and let the delicious meat juices get all over her supple breasts.</p>

	<p>Harold was intrigued. &ldquo;Just one moment darling,&rdquo; he said.</p> 

	<p>Harold came back with a fork, a steak knife, and a plate. He lifted the T-bone steak and put the plate under it. He wouldn&lsquo;t want to stab his poor woman. He started cutting the steak into perfectly sized bites, like a proper gentleman.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;My goodness, this steak is marvelous! Did you prepare it yourself madam?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look, Harold, don&lsquo;t you understand what it means to eat a girl out?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Harold was puzzled.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;You&lsquo;re not supposed to use a spoon, you&lsquo;re supposed to use your mouth, and your tongue. As for the steak, you&lsquo;re supposed to eat it off of me like a wild animal, take ferocious bites out of it like a tiger, accidentally nibble my breast a little bit, lick the juices off of me, that sort of thing. You don&lsquo;t have to be a proper gentleman for intercourse, darling.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&lsquo;re no fun anymore,&rdquo; said Harold.</p>
